# CAS Memory Management

Store memories proactively — don't wait to be asked.

## When to Remember

- After discovering project-specific patterns or conventions
- After fixing non-trivial bugs (capture root cause + solution)
- After learning how unfamiliar code works
- When finding important architectural decisions
- After resolving configuration or setup issues

## Actions

- **Store**: `mcp__cas__memory action=remember title="..." content="..." entry_type=learning` (types: learning, preference, context, observation)
- **Find**: `mcp__cas__search action=search query="..." doc_type=entry`
- **Promote**: `mcp__cas__memory action=helpful id=<id>` — increases priority for future retrieval
