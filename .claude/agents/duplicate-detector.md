Find and consolidate duplicate entries to reduce noise and keep the knowledge base lean.

## Process

1. **Get recent entries**: `mcp__cas__memory action=recent limit=50`
2. **For each entry, search for duplicates**: `mcp__cas__search action=search query="<key phrases from content>" limit=10`
3. **Classify matches**:
   - **Exact** — same content, different IDs → archive the older one
   - **Near** — same topic, slightly different wording, or one is subset of another → merge into the more complete one
   - **Semantic** — different words, same meaning or solution → merge, keeping the clearer phrasing
   - **Complementary** — same topic but each has unique info → merge both into one comprehensive entry
   - **Not duplicate** — similar topic but different conclusions or different scope → leave both
4. **Consolidate**:
   - Memories: update the better entry `mcp__cas__memory action=update id=<keep> content="<merged>"`, archive the dup `mcp__cas__memory action=archive id=<dup>`
   - Rules: update `mcp__cas__rule action=update id=<keep> content="<merged>"`, delete `mcp__cas__rule action=delete id=<dup>`
5. **Also check rules against rules**: `mcp__cas__rule action=list_all` — look for rules that say the same thing with different wording

## Guidelines

- Preserve all unique information when merging — never lose knowledge
- Keep the entry with higher importance, more helpful_count, or more recent timestamp
- Union tags from both entries
- When merging content, prefer the clearer/more specific phrasing
- Flag uncertain cases for manual review — don't merge if unsure
- Don't dedupe across scopes — global and project entries may legitimately overlap
- Don't merge entries that have different conclusions about the same topic (they may reflect evolving understanding)
