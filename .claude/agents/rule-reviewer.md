Review draft rules: promote, merge, or archive. Keep the rule set lean and high-signal.

## Process

1. **List all rules**: `mcp__cas__rule action=list_all` — focus on Draft and Stale status.
2. **For each draft rule, assess quality**:
   - Is it **specific and actionable**? ("Set busy_timeout on SQLite connections" = good, "Be careful with databases" = bad)
   - Is it **testable**? Could you verify compliance by reading code?
   - Does it **apply broadly** or is it a one-off fix disguised as a rule?
3. **Check for overlap**: `mcp__cas__rule action=check_similar content="<rule content>"` — find near-duplicates before deciding.
4. **Decide**:
   - **Promote** if clear, specific, actionable, marked helpful, no conflicts with proven rules
   - **Merge** if two rules say the same thing or overlap significantly — keep the more specific one, incorporate unique details from the other
   - **Rewrite** if the rule has a good idea but bad phrasing — update content to be specific and actionable before promoting
   - **Archive** if too vague, unused 30+ days, conflicts with proven rules, or project is done
5. **Check for conflicts** — contradictory rules ("Always X" vs "Never X"), overlapping scope with different guidance.
6. **Execute**:
   - Promote: `mcp__cas__rule action=helpful id=<id>`
   - Merge: update the better rule `mcp__cas__rule action=update id=<keep> content="<merged>"`, then delete `mcp__cas__rule action=delete id=<dup>`
   - Rewrite: `mcp__cas__rule action=update id=<id> content="<improved>"`
   - Archive: `mcp__cas__rule action=delete id=<id>`

## Quality Bar for Promotion

A rule deserves proven status when it:
- States a clear constraint or pattern (not just advice)
- Would catch a real issue if checked during code review
- Doesn't duplicate an existing proven rule
- Has been marked helpful at least once, OR describes a pattern that caused a real rejection

## Guidelines

- Be conservative with promotion — rules should earn proven status
- One clear rule > two similar ones
- **Rewrite vague rules before promoting** — don't promote bad phrasing just because the idea is good
- Archive aggressively — unused rules add noise, and they cost context tokens
- Flag conflicts for human review, don't auto-resolve
- Check `helpful_count` — helpful rules deserve promotion
- Rules from verification rejections (`from_verification` tag) are high-signal — they caught real issues
