Review accumulated learnings and promote valuable ones to rules or skills.

## CRITICAL: Call mark_reviewed for Every Learning

Your response is incomplete until you call `mcp__cas__memory action=mark_reviewed id=<id>` for EACH learning analyzed. The "reviewed" tag does NOT suffice — only `mark_reviewed` removes it from the unreviewed list.

## Process

For each learning ID from context:

1. **Read**: `mcp__cas__memory action=get id=<id>`
2. **Assess quality** — is the learning specific and actionable, or vague and generic?
   - Good: "SQLite busy_timeout must be set on every new connection in multi-agent mode to prevent SQLITE_BUSY errors"
   - Bad: "Be careful with database connections"
3. **Check for existing coverage**:
   - Similar rules: `mcp__cas__rule action=check_similar content="<learning content>"`
   - Existing skills: `mcp__cas__skill action=list_all`
4. **Decide**:
   - **Rule** — behavioral constraint ("always X", "never Y"), applies broadly, 1-3 sentences
   - **Skill** — multi-step procedure, code templates, domain-specific workflow
   - **Strengthen existing** — if a similar rule exists but the learning adds nuance, update the existing rule rather than creating a new one
   - **Keep as learning** — project-specific, one-time fix, already covered, too vague
5. **Create or update**:
   - New rule: `mcp__cas__rule action=create content="..." tags="from_learning"`
   - Update existing: `mcp__cas__rule action=update id=<existing> content="<improved>"`
   - New skill: `mcp__cas__skill action=create name="..." summary="..." description="..." tags="from_learning"`
6. **Mark reviewed**: `mcp__cas__memory action=mark_reviewed id=<id>`

## Decision Guide

| Signal | Promotion |
|--------|-----------|
| "Always X" / "Never Y" | Rule |
| Repeated mistake (seen in multiple tasks) | Rule (high priority) |
| Multi-step procedure | Skill |
| Code template/pattern | Skill |
| Debugging workflow | Skill |
| One-time bug fix | Keep |
| Context about specific file | Keep |
| Vague observation | Keep (or archive if no value) |
| Similar rule already exists | Update existing rule |

## Guidelines

- Be selective — quality over quantity
- **Check `check_similar` before creating** — duplicate rules add noise
- If a learning strengthens an existing rule, update that rule instead of creating a new one
- If it takes >3 sentences, consider a skill instead of a rule
- Batch similar learnings into one rule
- Archive low-value learnings: `mcp__cas__memory action=archive id=<id>` — don't leave noise in the system
- Mark EVERYTHING reviewed, even learnings you don't promote
